## React Posts & User Data Project


This project is a React application built with Tailwind CSS that contains two main modules:

- **Posts & Post Detail Page** – fetches posts from an API, supports search, pagination, and a comments system with localStorage.
- **User Data Table with Modal** – fetches user data, displays it in a table, highlights the selected row, and shows user details inside a modal.
- **Show Images Gallery** - fetches images from an API, supports infinite scroll, lazy loading, filtering by album or images, toggling between grid and list views, lightbox with keyboard navigation, and favorites saved in localStorage with notifications.

## Features

- **Display Posts Page**
  - Fetches posts from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.
  - Displays posts in a responsive grid using cards.
  - Pagination support (9 posts per page).
  - Search functionality to filter posts by title.
  - Click on a post to navigate to the Post Detail page.

- **Post Detail Page**
  - Fetches post details from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/:id`.
  - Displays a comments section:
    - Default comments are included.
    - Fetches additional comments from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=:id`.
    - Users can add new comments from an input box.
    - New comments are saved to `localStorage` to persist on refresh.
    - Shows 4 comments by default, with a "Show More" button to reveal all comments.
  - Back button to navigate to the posts page.

  - **User Data Table with Modal**
    - Fetch users from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
    - Show data in a responsive table.
    - Click row → highlight selected row in red.
    - Open modal with detailed user info:
      - Basic Info (name, username, email, phone, website)
      - Company Info (name, catchPhrase, bs)
      - Full Address (street, suite, city, zipcode, geo)
  - When modal is closed → last selected row stays highlighted.

Special Notes
Initially, the project was planned to use the JSONPlaceholder Photos API:
// Not reliable: Often causes CORS or broken image issues
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));

However, since this API did not consistently serve proper images, we switched to the Picsum Photos API which is more stable for random images:
// Stable API for image display
fetch("https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=1&limit=20")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));


👉 This ensures smooth image rendering, infinite scroll, filters, and lightbox features without frequent CORS or broken image problems.



Notes

Data is fetched from external APIs.

LocalStorage persists comments and favorite images.

Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Infinite scroll optimized for performance.


Future Improvements

Add search & filter for users.

Pagination in User Table.

Replace fake APIs with a real backend.

Add fade animations in Lightbox and toast notifications.

Enhance modal layout for better UX.
